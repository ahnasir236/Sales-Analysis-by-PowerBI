E-Commerce Project on Sales Analysis

The insights of sales and profits of the companies have been transformed into impactful visual stories using Power BI. 
The sales dataset in csv format has been used to deliver an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that helps to communicate the key findings effectively, making complex data accessible to stakeholders. 
The important sale’s features are focused on the dashboard. The Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) functions are used to interpret the sales data for better clarification of sales analysis and distribution.

Three slicers are created, namely, year, territory and deal size. Four cards are shown, namely, total quantity sold, total sales, average unit price of the product and sale’s percentage in the territory. The following dynamic charts are created.

-	Sales by the deal size (donut chart)
-	Profit by the deal size (pie chart)
-	Yearly revenue or sales (bar plot)
-	Sales done according to the countries with single territory (vertical bar chart)
-	Sales according to the seven products (horizontal bar chart)
